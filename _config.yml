  Data Science Enthusiast 
  <br><br>
  I have always had this passion of solving problems, while growing up, I had always seen myself being an engineer because I believed that engineers solve a large chunk of the world’s biggest problems. I studied Computer Engineering, driven by passion for my field I came top in my class, what a proud and fulfilling moment for me
  Reality sets in after graduation from the university, how do I make this knowledge useful? How do I use my skills to develop a career path that will solve world’s problems? Then, I got a job with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) as a Protection Data Administrator, one thing I am always grateful for. Although I was exposed to Database concepts during my undergraduate studies, it was really fulfilling seeing I could use my SQL skills to help manage data used to restore family links of displaced people. While working for the ICRC, I got to see the importance of data in any industry or sector and how data has helped so many businesses to make informed decision.
  All these played contributory roles in fueling my passion in the data science field. Imagine how a prediction can help people or businesses make amends and save them a whole lot of damages in the long run.
  Moving to the UK to join my husband, I had to quit the job I love so much because of the impact it has on people’s lives to begin a new life. It was not an easy decision for me but you know sometimes people make crazy decisions because of family. Now, I am faced to start searching for jobs, attending interviews and all those draining stuffs. In the midst of all that chaos as I will call it, I decided to nurse my passion. Signed up for a bootcamp on Data Science and Machine Learning by Udemy and I started following the course, I could start from morning and will continue like that till evening with no food, the interesting thing about this force of passion is that I do not even feel hungry, I am only hungry for knowledge. This continued for weeks then turned months and today, I am happy for the much knowledge and hands on experience I was able to gather within the period. With high hopes for this new adventure I am confident that the sky will be my starting point. I am really excited about starting a Junior Data Scientist role soon, whenever I think about the opportunities and the challenges ahead of me, I am thrilled it will be worth the effort and I am ready to take it on.
